					Humans and cats have been evolving together and adapting to each
					other. Throughout history, cats have provided humans with many
					services, and humans as well have served well to cats. Nowadays humans
					think they rule over all the other life forms, but
					<strong>only cats are out of this box</strong>, in fact, cats are the
					ones ruling over humans,

						without cats in their lifes humans are nothing but stray dogs, mere
						pitiful creatures wandering in the meaninglessness of existence</em
					>. That's why here, in
